Long songs last 10-15 seconds and consist of 5-10 distinct sections. They are quite complex—Roger Tory Peterson once likened it to 'a Chipping Sparrow trying to sing like a canary.' Males sing long songs early in the breeding season when they are trying to attract mates, and generally stop singing the long versions when they have found a mate. After that they sing mostly short songs, which last 1.5 to 3 seconds and typically consist of 2 trilled sections, with the first usually being faster and higher pitched. Some elements of each song type are nearly identical to phrases sung by Clay-colored and Chipping Sparrows. Short songs continue throughout breeding, and sometimes even at night or on the wintering grounds.

They use other variations of calls during flight, courtship chases, courtship feeding rituals, and aggressive interactions. Only the male sings, and usually only on the breeding grounds, though sometimes during migration as well. His song is a jumble of high, thin notes that lasts up to 1.5 seconds.

Among these are a purr-like call given as the bird takes flight, and a rattle that starlings make as they join a flock on the ground. Two types of screamlike calls indicate aggression and are often accompanied by flapping wings: one is a chattering call (described as  "" chackerchackerchacker "" ); the other is a high-pitched trill. Starlings also make metallic chip notes to other flock members and when harassing or mobbing predators. Starlings are relatives of the mynah birds, and like them they have impressive vocal abilities and a gift for mimicry. They can warble, whistle, chatter, make smooth liquid sounds, harsh trills and rattles, and imitate meadowlarks, jays, and hawks. The songs tend to consist of either loud whistles or softer, jumbled warbling. Whistled songs are a few seconds long, often used between males. Warbled songs can go on for more than a minute, and seem mainly directed at females. Males sing several varieties of each of these two classes of songs. Females also sing, particularly in the fall.

Some of the passages of song begin with a soft, mellow sound that rises clearer and louder, and which has been likened to the howl of a dingo. Males call many hours daily in the peak of the winter breeding season; quiet at other times. The Green Catbird and Satin Bowerird feature strongly in its imitations. In alarm gives a shrill shriek.

Call is a series of notes, initially slow, sharp, becoming lower, richer, faster, increasingly powerful, almost painfully loud if the bird comes close under low cover.
